<!-- Reading Response 3 -- Surveillance Capitalism -- 0228 -- Tina-->
- Through the explanation Shoshana Zuboff made about what Surveillance Capitalism is, I understand it to be a system where individual behaviours are gradually and forcefully brought into the economic market as behavioural data. There was some time that I naively thought, or to say, humbly deceive myself, that the data collected are finally going to serve us, the so-called "users". I deceived myself that the data like searching records on shopping apps are going to make my life easier since the app will directly pop up the things I am searching to buy. However, after hearing this speech made by Shoshana Zuboff, it changed my mind. Now, I think I knew about data privacy, but I feel like I have never known that.
- I was really impressed by Shoshana Zuboff's saying that "if you have nothing to hide then you are nothing". In this context, privacy is no longer only about where you have been, what you have bought, what you have searched, etc. It is far more than that. All the things that inside you, which should not and could be perceived or grabbed or stolen by others are all privacy of you. The book we read formed our values. The experiences we have formed our mindsets. The education we took formed our brains and critical thinking. These are all properties of our own. But through today's data collection under the silent Surveillance Capitalism system, these things of ourselves are gradually stolen by those corporations in the name of serving "users" better to make their profits. However, even at this point, I still hold the belief that there are some data can be shared and would eventually make our life better as a whole, though I still have not figured out what sort of data should be included in that category and how should we do to ensure and supervise how the data are being used.
- Last but not least, I still have a few questions coming up in my mind. For example, although more and more people are getting informed and conscious about the problem of data privacy and Surveillance Capitalism, how can we do to protect ourselves from being infringed or violated by the whole system when we are still having an essential need of using those apps and those Internet engines. One ridicule is that I even used Google to watch the video of Shoshana Zuboff's speech which was posted on YouTube, and there was even an ad that I had to watch before watching the Zuboff's speech.
