<!-- Reading Response 4 -- Prediction & Uncertainty -- 0314 -- Tina-->
- List of three examples of contemporary prediction system/application:
- 1. Weather Forecasting
In our times, we are applying predictive analysis to our daily life a lot in many different industries. The first example that I can think of, I suppose, is the most direct and useful one around us. It is the weather-prediction system. Not only including the weather forecast, but also about the system that is used to predict whether there will be meteorological disasters like earthquakes, tornados, mudslides, etc. This is one of the most meaningful ways that I can think of for applying prediction methods. Natural disasters are always accompanying by properties like instant and disastrous. Predicting the time and place of the happen of natural disasters accurately can effectively help save time for residents to retreat and for professionals to reduce the effects that natural disasters may bring about. This can actually save lives.
- 2. Shopping/Travelling Application
The second example may go to the shopping or travelling application that we are more and more relying on in our daily life. In those applications, our data like shopping records and viewing history will be collected by the application and then be used to predict what we are looking for, what we want to buy, or where we want to go, and then, send recommendations to you about those products and services. This cannot only help the companies to figure out what customers like and stimulate them to see more and buy more, but it can also help customers save some time. However, one possible fatal problem to the whole system can be the privacy problem.
- 3. Business Marketing
The third one that I can think of is in the business marketing industry. As the business markets become more diverse, cover a wider range, marketers start to use big data analysis, too. With the use of big data analysis, they can base on the past actions, like the shopping records, to analyse each customer's need. With the use of big data analysis, marketers can make easier access to their exact sales and the market size, which can further determine their production decisions.
