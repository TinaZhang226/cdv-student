<!-- Reading Response 4 -- Prediction & Uncertainty -- 0314 -- Tina-->
- List of three examples of contemporary prediction system/application:
- 1. Weather Forecasting
In our times, we are applying predictive analysis to our daily life a lot in many different industries. The first example that I can think of, I suppose, is the most direct and useful one around us. It is the weather-prediction system. Not only including the weather forecast, but also about the system that is used to predict whether there will be meteorological disasters like earthquakes, tornados, mudslides, etc. This is one of the most meaningful ways that I can think of for applying prediction methods. Natural disasters are always accompanying by properties like instant and disastrous. Predicting the time and place of the happen of natural disasters accurately can effectively help save time for residents to retreat and for professionals to reduce the effects that natural disasters may bring about. This can actually save lives.
- 2. Shopping/Travelling Application
The second example may go to the shopping or travelling application that we are more and more relying on in our daily life. In those applications, our data like shopping records and viewing history will be collected by the application and then be used to predict what we are looking for, what we want to buy, or where we want to go, and then, send recommendations to you about those products and services. This cannot only help the companies to figure out what customers like and stimulate them to see more and buy more, but it can also help customers save some time. However, one possible fatal problem to the whole system can be the privacy problem.
- 3. Business Marketing
The third one that I can think of is in the business marketing industry. As the business markets become more diverse, cover a wider range, marketers start to use big data analysis, too. With the use of big data analysis, they can base on the past actions, like the shopping records, to analyse each customer's need. With the use of big data analysis, marketers can make easier access to their exact sales and the market size, which can further determine their production decisions.
- Reflection on Collective Average vs Individual Fate
- It is true that collective average is derived and collected from huge amounts of individual examples, so it should be related to individual fate. And it is also true that we, the individuals, are hard to determined or predicted by the collective average data, which was measured by the big data analysis, machine learning algorithms, etc. So, as far as I'm concerned, I believe that how close the relationship between collective average and individual fate is should be determined by which industry the prediction method is being used in. For example, when considering the business marketing, it does not have a close relationship. The target of marketers is to find out what kind of products do the markets need, how large the market size is, and how many production can make the most profits. So, they only need the collective average. As customers, all we want is to exchange for the things we need, the only thing that marketers' decision would affect us is the price, and the effect will usually be subtle. Therefore, in this kind of industry, neither the prediction of consumer behaviour would bring much effect to our individual fate, nor our individual behaviour affect the collective average a lot. However, if it is applied in industry such as health care industry, the prediction are very much customised, so it relies on the individual data more, and also need to give detailed instruction for each patient. The detailed process contained four steps. First, apply wearable devices for customers to build the network. Second, collect their data with the use of IoT. Third, train the data to AI use machine learning. Lastly, regularise the data, use the collective average to predict the disease, and warn the users when they are affected by some diseases, technically speaking, when they are "detected" as affected by some diseases. The first reason that in this case collective average is much closer related to individual fate is that healthcare can be said to be the most important aspect in one individual's life. Second, health is not like consumption needs. In healthcare, each case is highly differentiate with others. Also, there are too many different causes for one disease and relatively, the data examples are too limited. Therefore, each individual data may have larger effect on the collective average, and once we decided to believe in the average, it may also have deeper effect on ourselves.
