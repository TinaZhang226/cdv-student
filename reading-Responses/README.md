Meaning and Importance of "Context"
In both articles "Critical Questions for Big Data" and "Data Humanism", the authors mentioned the term "context" and placed great importance to it. From my own understanding, the context they are referring to is a general summary of all kinds of background information about a data, for instance, under what circumstances are the data generated from, who are the data tracing, and for what reason are those things that the data are representing done, etc. I really agree with the crucial status of "context" in data analysis. Besides the examples listed in the articles, like "tie-strength" on social media, another situation that I can think of which may cause misunderstanding due to lack of context is the data of shopping records. There is an increasing number of businesses start to trace their users' viewing and buying records for the sake of future development and recommendation. However, sometimes, without context, those recommendation may be on the wrong track. For example, a person who buys a bunch of stationary may work as a stocking clerk for his/her company, and they may have rules about what to buy. In that case, recommending a variety of stationary may be meaningless.</br>
If the authors of the two articles can have a chance to communicate with each other, I believe they would agree with each other on the opinion that data has limitations. "Data represents real life, ..., but sometimes it can get lost. Failing to represent these limitations and nuances and blindly putting numbers in a chart is like reviewing a movie by analysing the chemical properties of the cellulose on which the images were recorded." (Lupi)"Data are not generic. There is value to analysing data abstractions, yet retaining context remains critical, particularly for certain lines of inquiry."(Boyd, Crawford) Although "Data Humanism" concentrates on data visualisation while the other put emphasis on doing research, it is clearly shown that they all agree that data has limitations inherently and should not be analysed solely without any context or deep understanding.
Last but not least, as far as I am concerned, collecting more data itself is nothing bad, the drawbacks that are mentioned in the article "Critical Questions for Big Data" are actually caused by our subjective biases. To be clearer, when researchers are doing an experiment, most of them start with a hypothesis, therefore, no matter to what extent, it is quite inevitable that they will have the subjective biases, making them tend to believe and focus more on the data that agrees with their hypothesis. This problem is rooted in our psychological subconscious, and should not be owed to big data's problem. And about the conclusion that "big does not equal to better", I pretty much agree on that. But I think seeking for more data is nothing wrong, instead, the thing that should be changed is our mindset. No matter the quantity of data is large or not, we should always keep ourselves critical to them, since even large quantity of data can have selection bias, and we should never over-trust the power of "large quantity".
