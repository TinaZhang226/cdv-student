- "Do we have the right to be forgotten?" has been a heated topic since the use of Internet booms. And I am glad to hear from this podcast that there are already people who have stepped forward than that and started to think about how to judge "who have the right to be forgotten", and it's gonna never be an easy path.
- After knowing about those cases, I formed several guidelines in my mind which I think should be considered when making the decisions of deleting or non-deleting specific articles.
### 1. The severity of the guilt made in the past.
- Different faults that are recorded on the Internet should be treated differently. For example, a small theft case may be allowed to be deleted, while a case of killing someone should not be deleted in any way. However, tricky cases can be, use what mentioned in the podcast as an example, killing someone but was sealed as self-defended, how should we dealt with those cases, when it is hard to judge the severity of the case.
### 2. The relevancy between the past guilt and the current activity one is doing.
- I was inspired to add this into my guidelines due to the police officer case. There was a heated discussion, and they finally decided to non-deleted it after the Tamir Rice was brought in. However, I was thinking about the police officer may not be suitable to be a police officer, but should this record be visible to all, is there a need for that? For example, if he is looking for a scientist job instead of a police officer, then should the employer have the access to this past record. Probably, I am guessing, that the unfitness of being a police officer may leave an impression to his future employer that he is lack of consideration before doing things, etc. However, this may not be the whole picture of his failure-as-a-police-officer story. And simply leaving it online may have negative effects on his future life. Therefore, I want to suggest that the records should be kept and showed to only police office. Showing the relevant information to those who really need it, rather than show it to the public. However, the difficulties are easy to imagine, how to judge the relevancy of one's future job with the past records? And how to judge what another person is searching this guy for?
- System like ClearView is really controversial. I agree on what the police officer answered in the podcast, from a police perspective, it is really making our life easier and can help them with many dead-ended cases, while from a personal perspective, this technology is just shocking and can be harmful to the public. I also agreed on that "we can just keep it in the good and right track". However, after knowing the fact that the reporter's photos are showed with "no records", I felt rather shocked and started to hesitate if using it, even just within the police system, is suitable. It is undeniable that this technology can make the police's life much easier and rapidly increase the speed of solving cases. However, the technology is developed and controlled by the somehow "unknown" company. And the case of reporter's photo has already showed the fact that they tech company can manipulate the data and the results to some extent. Leave alone if the tech company is really only serving this tech to the police system, which no one exactly knows, just the manipulation they can do to the tech is shocking. Imagine, after the police system is getting used to use this app to help them solve the case and see how efficient and accurate it works, they will begin to rely more and more on the app and give more and more trust to this tech. At that time, if the company just cooperate with the criminals, and when the police officers are searching the criminals with one vague photo of them, the tech company can simply manipulate the results and give a wrong but similar answer to the correct one. Who can assure that he/she has the ability to find out? That could be rather shocking than just "the end of privacy". And even someone found out, the person may already be falsely arrested for years, and the tech company can just simply reply as "it is a bug", as what they did to reply the reporter.
- This recalls me of a famous quote that "People are always making decisions between the right way and the easy way". The unlimited pursue of technology is inherently our endless desire to make our life easier.
