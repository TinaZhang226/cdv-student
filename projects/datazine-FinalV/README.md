### What data did I choose to collect?
- Above are the webpages that I created for this data zine project. In this project, I chose to collect data about __me being absent-minded__.This idea was inspired by the psychology course that I am taking. Having learned some basic knowledge about mind and consciousness, I would like to grab this chance to collect the data related to my mind.
### How did I collect it, and what was the routine?
- So, how did I collect the data and what specific data did I collect? Indeed, it is hard to notice that I myself am absent-minded. So, in those days, I wrote daily plans and __tried to concentrate myself on doing one thing during a certain period of time__. Then, each time that I thought of other things than my assigned task, I would write down on the paper or fill one google form to record the data. The data I collected mainly cover “What I was supposed to be doing” / “What made me absent-minded” / “How long have I been absent-minded” / “What time is it?” and if I missed some information, “How important was the information that I missed”, etc.
### Why did I choose to visualize the data in this way?
- When thinking about how to visualize the data, I first thought about making an icon to show a kind of image that can show the meaning of absent-minded. Primarily, I thought of creating an image of the brain, but I do not want the icon to be too biology-looking. Then a __cloud__ image just appeared in my mind, and I felt like it can well represent the idea of __being absent-minded__, like __a cloud is blowing away__ etc. Therefore, I created this shape. And add on more information to it.
- The __arc__ here is __clock-looking__, but I did not copy the clock, instead, since I have separated one day into 4 time periods, I feel like using the circle to represent the whole day (24 hours) is clearer.
### What can be seen in the visualization? Does it reveal something I didn't expect?
- There are several things that could be seen from this visualization. For example, through the __background shape's opacity__, we can see that most of my absent-mindedness has a __relatively short period of time__, which is mostly between 1-3 minutes. Also, through simple counting, we can conclude that I was absent-minded for the most times when I was __doing an assignment__ or __taking a course__. However, this should not simply be concluded as I am more likely to be absent-minded when doing assignments or taking courses, since the frequency and duration of doing these two things are occupying most of my time in a day.
- During processing the data, I coincidently found out that there seems to be __a decreasing trend of me being absent-minded__. I guess it may be because the deliberate action of collecting data has some impact on my subconscious, making me pay more attention to focus on my work. And that is why my back page is created like that.
### Did I make crucial compromises? Which ones?
- One major compromise that I made might be giving up the original data that I collected, since they are too complicated to process. The original data that I collected have 10 sections of question in total. And I designed a lot of conditional questions, such as "if you choose A in the first question, then go to answer question 13", etc. I feel like it may be too hard to show all these data points on only four pages. And some of the icon key may even not have a chance to be represented on the webpage. Therefore, I tried to simplify my data collection form.
### If this project had a larger scaler and wasn't designed for print, how would I imagine it to be?
- If not for print and can have larger scale, I hope that each data point can be interactive. The data points can be magnified when people are approaching it, and people can see more details about what each part of the data point means, and might include some videos or illustrations representing what I thought of, which can make the data more intuitive and contain more information.
