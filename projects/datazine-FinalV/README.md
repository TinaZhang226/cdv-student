## What data did I choose to collect?
- Here is the webpage that I created for this data zine project. In this project, I chose to collect data about me being absent-minded. So, how did I collect the data and what specific data did I collect? Indeed, it is hard to notice that I myself am absent-minded. So, in those days, I wrote daily plans and tried to concentrate myself on doing one thing during a certain period of time. Then, each time that I thought of other things than my assigned task, I would write down on the paper or fill one google form to record the data. The data I collected mainly cover “What I was supposed to be doing” / “What made me absent-minded” / “How long have I been absent-minded” / “What time is it?” and if I missed some information, “How important was the information that I missed”, etc.
- When thinking about how to visualize the data, I first thought about making an icon to show a kind of image that can show the meaning of absent-minded. Primarily, I thought of creating an image of the brain, but I do not want the icon to be too biology-looking. Then a cloud image just appeared in my mind, and I felt like it can well represent the idea of being absent-minded, like a cloud is blowing away etc. Therefore, I created this shape. And add on more information to it.
- The arc here is clock-looking, but I did not copy the clock, instead, since I have separated one day into 4 time periods, I feel like using the circle to represent the whole day (24 hours) is clearer.
- During processing the data, I coincidently found out that there seems to be a decreasing trend of me being absent-minded. I guess it may be because the deliberate action of collecting data has some impact on my subconscious, making me pay more attention to focus on my work. And that is why my back page is created like that.
- One major compromise that I made might be giving up the original data that I collected, since they are too complicated to process.
If not for print and can have larger scale, I hope that each data point can be interactive. The data points can be magnified when you approach it, and people can see details about what each part of the data point means.
