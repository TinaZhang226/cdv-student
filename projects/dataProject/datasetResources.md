## [IMDB Movie Rating](https://data.world/himan/imdb-movie-dataset)
- IMDB is a famous online database of information related to films, television programs, etc. The database includes information about directors' names, duration, main actors, genres, movie titles, number of voted users, language, production country, years of publishing, and the rating scores. This dataset is updated on Feb 3, 2021, and the movie covered is collected from 1916-2016, which is long time period. I think this dataset is good, especially because of its long time period, which can give me more room to analyse and draw to some conclusions by myself. If using this dataset, I think I can focus my visualisation on the trend of the genres the public like, or maybe splitting the 100 years to several data groups and compare public's interest on those categories.

- This dataset is updated on Dec.18, 2019. Unlike the first dataset, although this is also about movies, this dataset mainly focuses on understanding the popularity rating of a film and identify relationships between the budget, cast, and rating of the film. If using this dataset, I want to create a visualisation showing people which factor may be the most dependable one in determining the final rating or reputation of a film.
